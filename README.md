#Multiclass Logistic  Classification and Naive Bayes #
In this toy project, we aim to build a multiclass logistic and naive bayes clssifier that predicts the language cotegory of a given text.

• We wrote a function to load the data

• Yet another function was written to train the model
• We finally wrote a prediction and accuracy function
Here is the link to the naive bayes notebook
