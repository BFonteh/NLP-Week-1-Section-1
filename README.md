#Multiclass Logistic  Classification #
In this toy project, we aim to build a multiclass logistic clssifier that predicts the language cotegory of a given text.

• We wrote a function to load the data

• Yet another function was written to train the model
• We finally wrote a prediction and accuracy function

# Run the project #
In this project, we have two steps: training and predicting. In the predict step, you can type a sentence as a review  and predict it. Let's show you how to run the project.

If you do not have venv package, please refer to this [link](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-python-virtual-environments-on-ubuntu-18-04/)
</br>

## Create virtual environment ##

```
$ python3 -m venv ENV_NAME
```
## Activate your environment ##

```
$ source ENV_NAME/bin/activate
```

## Requirement installations ##
To run this, make sure to install all the requirements by:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
# Training the model #

```
$ python3 main.py 
```

# Results Presentation

```Validation Accuracy result```  </br>
